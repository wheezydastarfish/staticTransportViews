# How it Works

Static Transport Views is a simple mod that keeps your selected transport lines hidden or shown permenantly. 
Currently, when closing the transport overview window via the X in the top right, it will reset all transport views to shown again. This makes navigating transport difficult. 
This mod keeps the transport reset from occuring, which means all lines will now keep their hidden or visible status permenantly.

This means no matter how you close your transport window, all your selections stay the same. 
Adding new transport lines will make them visible by default, but once you mark it as hidden, it will stay hidden.
