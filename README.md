# How it Works

Static Transport Views is a simple mod that keeps your selected transport lines hidden or shown permenantly. 
Currently, when closing the transport window via the X in the top right, it will reset all transport views to shown again as well as your selected objects. This makes navigating transport difficult. 

Static Transport Views makes all selection static, not allowing them to change.
This means no matter how you close your transport window, all your selections stay the same. 
Adding new transport lines will make them visible by default, but once you mark it as hidden, it will stay hidden.
It will also keep all of your selected transportation objects (stops, stations, etc.) checked or unchecked until you check it again.
